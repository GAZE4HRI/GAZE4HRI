# This is avatar app for android working as a replacment for robot in gaze HRI experiments
Build with android studio, tested 29 sdk.

## Start 
On first screen will be text field to define mqtt broker address, if you type it correctly and hit show main button main screen will show up.
best practise is to first start mqtt then android app and then python server (if using microservices for recognition new_framework_microservices start them before python server)
